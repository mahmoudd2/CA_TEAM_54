.global <instruction_name>

<instruction_name>:
    ; Get operands from registers or memory based on calling convention (C calling conventions vary)
    ; Example (assuming operands are passed in registers):
    MOV R1, [esp + 4]  ; Assuming first operand is in 4th byte of stack frame
    MOV R2, [esp + 8]  ; Assuming second operand is in 8th byte of stack frame

    ; Perform the instruction operation
    ADD R3, R1, R2  ; Example for ADD instruction

    ; Store the result in the destination register or memory
    ; Example (assuming result goes to register R0):
    MOV [esp], R3  ; Assuming result is stored in the first byte of the stack frame

    RET  ; Return control to the C program
